*Quote* I felt overwhelmed by stimuli from within: thoughts. Thoughts that raced around my head like Formula 1 cars, lap after lap. Usually something like this happens the day after a busy workday with lots of communication. I’m tired, I’d love to just go to sleep, but at the same time my head just keeps racing. There’s a schedule with a thousand things to be done and I’m way too hyper to go to sleep. But I’m tired. But I have things to do. But I’m tired.

*Note:* If autism is a sensory processing disorder, maybe adhd is just autism specifically for thoughts?


*Quote* But why the obsessions? And why these specific subjects? Experts think predictability is a factor. Most autistic people’s hobbies can be categorised or are logical or predictable. Horses or birds belong to animal species and have certain characteristics. Computers do what you tell them to do. (And if they don’t, that’s usually because you – or the software developer – made a mistake. A computer can’t just go and decide to do something wrong because it doesn’t like you, no matter how many people say it can.) Stamps can go into an album, bicycle race results can be compared. And sorting, categorising and calculating simply makes most autistics very happy.

*Quote* That doesn’t just explain autistic people’s hypersensitivity, but also their apparent insensitivity and limitations in social communication. We close up in the overwhelming storm of stimuli, like a computer that freezes when you give it ten different tasks at the same time.

*Quote* A more inclusive, more comprehensive explanation can be found in the Intense World Theory, a theory that has been gaining more credence in the past few years. The founders of this theory, neuroscientists Henry and Kamila Markram, have an autistic son. Their findings resonate with what a lot of autistic people actually already know: the autistic brain is hyperactive. According to the Markrams, more connections are being made in the autistic brain and brain cells respond more emphatically to each other. There’s a stronger response to stimuli, thoughts run rampant quicker. In short: the world is extremely intense for autistics.

*Quote* And in my head I go around and around about whether my fellow Nadirites suffer the same steep self-disgust. From a height, watching them, I usually imagine that the other passengers are to the impassively contemptuous gaze of the local merchants, service people, photo-op-with-lizard vendors, etc. I usually imagine that my fellow tourists are too bovinely self-absorbed to even notice how we’re looked at. At other times, though, it occurs to me that the other Americans on board quite possibly feel the same vague discomfort about their bovine role in port that I do, but that they refuse to let their boviscopophobia rule them: they’ve paid good money to have fun be pampered and record some foreign experiences, and they’ll be goddamned if they’re going to let some self-indulgent of neurotic projection about how their Americanness appears to malnourished locals detract from the 7NC Luxury Cruise worked and saved for and decided they deserve.

*Quote* Where Asperger saw threads of genius and disability inextricably intertwined in his patients’ family histories—testifying to the complex genetic roots of their condition and the “social value of this personality type,” as he put it—Kanner saw the shadow of the sinister figure that would become infamous in popular culture as the “refrigerator mother.” He was an astute clinical observer and a persuasive writer, but in this case his errors in interpreting his patients’ behavior had wide-reaching implications. By blaming parents for inadvertently causing their children’s autism, Kanner made his syndrome a source of shame and stigma for families worldwide while sending autism research off in the wrong direction for decades.

*Quote* It was as if the children were constantly generating rules about how things should be based on how they were when they happened to come across them. A walk taken along a certain route one day had to be taken the same way every time after that. A random sequence of actions—such as the flushing of a toilet and the switching off of lights before bedtime—instantly became a ritual that had to be endlessly reiterated. The most humble and ordinary day-to-day events became imbued with terrifying significance.

*Quote* Karl Bonhoeffer, a pioneering neurologist. Bonhoeffer parted ways with the father of diagnostic psychiatry, Emil Kraepelin, by pointing out the deceptively seductive power of naming a condition. The problem with labels, he said, is that they seem to correspond to disease entities that live independently of the patient, like types of viruses or bacteria. But in psychiatry, labels describe constellations of behavior that can be related to any number of underlying conditions.

*Quote* Mindful of the poet Horace’s advice that profound truths are often best disguised as jokes (“Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat?” or “What prevents a laughing man from telling the truth?”)
