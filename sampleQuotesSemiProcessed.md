*quote:*	For 360 minutes per diem, we receive unconscious reinforcement of the deep thesis that the most significant quality of truly alive persons is watchableness, and that genuine human worth is not just identical with but rooted in the phenomenon of watching.

*quote:*	Tasmania’s south-west, the great wilderness mecca, is by some criteria a biodiversity desert. Diversity of mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, fish and plants is low. More reptile species (twelve) roam through my backyard than occupy south-west Tasmania, and my local creek, thick with weeds, supports many more kinds of rainforest tree, including an endangered myrtle.

*quote:*	Explorer Dirk Hartog summed matters up in 1616. ‘This land is cursed,’ he wrote, ‘the animals hop, not run, the birds run, not fly, and the swans are black, not white.’

*quote:*	We hear so much these days about wildlife dying out, as if nature en masse were sliding down the drain. The truth is more interesting. Many native things are thriving by riding on our coat-tails. Seagulls, ravens, magpies, red-back spiders and bulrushes have never known better times. Their futures brightened when people came to the great south land.

*quote:*	“The gesture that precipitates this insight for most people is an attempt to invert consciousness upon itself—to look for that which is looking—and to notice, in the first instant of looking for your self, what happens to the apparent divide between subject and object. Do you still feel that you are over there, behind your eyes, looking out at a world of objects?”
